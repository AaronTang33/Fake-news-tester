Hi, my name is Aaron Tang and I've created a Fake News Detector that uses the Passive Aggressive Classifier from the sklearn package.
Additionally, I've used matplotlib and seaborn to create visualizations of the results.
This approach consistently resulted in an accuracy greater than 92%.

Packages Used: pandas, numpy, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib

Currently, I am building another classifer using the Multilayer Perceptron Model with the help of Tensorflow and the Keras API
